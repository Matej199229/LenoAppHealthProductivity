## Leno Website Project

A website for an app that serves as a productivity booster for developers. Used many important aspects of HTML/CSS to create the various parts of the website such as:
    -iframes, svg elements, positioning, box-shadow
    -flexbox and CSS grid
    -custom properties, smooth scrolling, sticky navbar (with help of a bit of vanilla JavaScript)
    -advanced selectors such as pseudo elements (::before, ::after), nth-of-child,nth-of-type
    -transitions and animations
    -added web accesibility features for screen readers
    -website is fully responsive for various screen sizes
    -a little bit of JS to assist with hamburger menu on mobile devices and changing the bg color of navbar on scroll

CSS is written using BEM methodology to create a hierarchy of classes for each section and improve code readibility. Hosted on Netlify.
